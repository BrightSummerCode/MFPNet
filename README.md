# RdmkNet & Toronto-Rdmk: Large-scale Datasets for Road Marking Classification and Segmentation

## Abstract
Effective road marking classification and segmentation are essential in enhancing vehicle-to-everything (V2X) applications and refining road inventory databases. Recognizing the challenges posed by the unique characteristics of 3D point clouds and the scarcity of large-scale point-level annotated datasets, we present two benchmarks: RdmkNet and Toronto-Rdmk, tailored for road marking tasks within intricate urban settings. To further leverage these datasets and address the stated challenges, this study introduces MFPNet â€” a multi-level feature optimization network structure.


## Datasets
Our work is underscored by two meticulously crafted datasets for road marking classification and segmentation:
